1. Request Flow:
AuthApplication.java->UserController.java->UserServiceImpl.java->UserRepo.java

2. From controller its better to use service layer rather than directly invoking repo layer.

3. The DTO only used to carry data till service layer. In service layer real entity has to be populated for database insert.

4. Aim of this Auth Module:
Develop rest API to store user information. Using these API we can achieve login functionality.
